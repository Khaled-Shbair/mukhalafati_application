# 🚀 Mukhalafati Application

**Mukhalafati** is an advanced traffic management solution that leverages modern technology and artificial intelligence to enhance road safety and traffic regulation. This comprehensive application uses mobile phone cameras to monitor vehicle speeds and automatically issues violations to drivers exceeding speed limits. By enabling electronic entry and instant storage of violations in the system's database, it significantly improves efficiency and reduces the workload on traffic police.

The app integrates notifications and electronic payment options, allowing drivers to pay fines seamlessly. It also features an electronic driver's license, simplifying verification and reducing the need for physical documents.

**Mukhalafati** aims to revolutionize road safety, modernize traffic violation management, and provide a more convenient experience for both traffic police and drivers. Specifically designed for the Gaza Strip, the app operates exclusively on Android and iOS platforms and is currently available in Arabic.

This project focuses on creating an AI-based mobile application tailored to Gaza's unique traffic management needs, aiming to save lives, reduce economic losses from accidents, and streamline traffic authority operations. With **Mukhalafati**, road safety and traffic efficiency are enhanced, offering a state-of-the-art solution for all driving license holders and traffic authorities in the region.
